# Financial Data Analysis System

This repository hosts a system for analyzing financial data from Excel and PDF files. It calculates key metrics like Revenue, Gross Profit, and EBITDA, generates insightful questions, and produces PDF reports. Deployable on Vercel, it features a React front-end for user interaction and a Node.js back-end for processing, with Python scripts handling data ingestion and report generation.

## Methodology

The system operates through these key steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Custom Python scripts (`ingest_xlsx.py` and `ingest_pdf.py`) process Excel and PDF files, extracting financial data.
2. **Metric Calculation**: Scripts (`calc_metrics.py`) compute financial metrics based on the ingested data.
3. **Question Generation**: The `questions_engine.py` script creates questions from the metrics to drive deeper analysis.
4. **Report Generation**: The `report_generator.py` script compiles metrics and questions into PDF reports, stored and served via Vercel Blob.

Data is managed in a PostgreSQL database with tables for companies, periods, financial metrics, derived metrics, questions, and reports, as defined in `financial_schema.sql` and `question_templates.sql`.

## Technologies

- **Front-End**: React for the user interface (`client/` directory).
- **Back-End**: Node.js (`server/server.js`) for API endpoints and processing.
- **Scripts**: Python for data handling and report generation (`scripts/` directory).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage (`schema/` directory).
- **Deployment**: Vercel for hosting and scalability.
